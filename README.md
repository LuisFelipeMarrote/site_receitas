This is the backend of a recipes website, the framework implemented was Nodejs. 

I also used some extesions as:
express ->  Created the app so I could created a route. 
cors -> Helped the linkage from the front-end to back-end in a safer way. 
mysql -> Allowed the back-end code connect to a local mysql workbench.  

Here a link in case you don't have Nodejs in your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download
The extesions are already inside the project so there is no need in downloading them.
