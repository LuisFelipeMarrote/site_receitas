Some importante packages used were:
express ->  Created the abstraction for routing. 
cors -> Helped the linkage from the front-end to back-end in a safer manner. 
mysql -> Allowed the back-end code connect to a local mysql workbench.  

Here a link in case you don't have Nodejs in your computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download
The packages are already inside the project so there is no need in downloading them.

In order to run, it's very simple, open the terminal inside the folder of the project, where the index.js is located. Next, if it's your first time running the applicantion, write "npm run build", then "npm run start".
